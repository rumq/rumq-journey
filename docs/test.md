# Blendle's Employee Handbook

This is a living document with everything we've learned working with people while running a startup. And, of course, we continue to learn. Therefore it's a document that will continue to change. 

**Everything related to working at Blendle and the people of Blendle, made public.**

These are the lessons from three years of working with the people of Blendle. It contains everything from [how our leaders lead](https://www.notion.so/ecfb7e647136468a9a0a32f1771a8f52) to [how we increase salaries](https://www.notion.so/Salary-Review-f0827140d1894f45a53c4cda3e1e4dd8), from [how we hire](https://www.notion.so/Hiring-16f863c3d0eb4975b33bc03a0d46a9a0) and [fire](https://www.notion.so/Firing-626a878572264353a9ca6468690ad79e) to [how we think people should give each other feedback](https://www.notion.so/Our-Feedback-Process-8e0d8b4623094918bba8a3999535a5b7) — and much more.

We've made this document public because we want to learn from you. We're very much interested in your feedback (including weeding out typo's and Dunglish ;)). Email us at hr@blendle.com. If you're starting your own company or if you're curious as to how we do things at Blendle, we hope that our employee handbook inspires you.
